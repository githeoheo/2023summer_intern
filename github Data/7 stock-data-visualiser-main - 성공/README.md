### ðŸš€ I will be working on this experiment again during summer 2023... stay tuned!

# Stock Data Visualiser

This is a simple stock data visualiser that uses the [Alpha Vantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/) to get stock data. I built this to learn more about data crunching and visualisation. The aim of this project is to build a fully functional LSTM model that predicts future stock prices based on historical prices using PyTorch. It is currently in development, and I will be adding more features as I learn more about data visualisation.

## Usage

You can either run the program using the command line, or by using the Jupyter Notebook (locally or on Google Colab - recommended).

### Command Line

To run the program using the command line, run the following command:

```bash
python lstm-model/train.py
```

**Experimental: I am currently developing a web app to pair with this project.** You can run the web app using the following command:

```bash
cd client
yarn install
yarn run dev
```
